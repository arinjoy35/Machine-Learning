Objective: 
The project is to compare two problem solving approaches to software development: the logic-based approach (Software 1.0) and the machine learning approach (Software
2.0). It is also designed to quickly gain familiarity with Python and machine learning frameworks.

Task:
We consider the task of FizzBuzz. In this task an integer divisible by 3 is printed as Fizz, and integer divisible by 5 is printed as Buzz. An integer divisible by both 3 and
5 is printed as FizzBuzz. If an integer is not divisible by 3 or 5 or 15, it simply prints the input as output (for this last case, the input number can be classified as Other in
Software 2.0, it should then be handled using Software 1.0, which prints the input as output).
